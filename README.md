Hello! I'm a programming enthusiast looking to better my software development skills and
eventually earn a junior engineer position. Feel free to browse my ever-growing repositories,
to try my applications out, and to offer suggestions and improvements. I'm always learning,
and am excited to continue doing so for the entirety of my journey to become a great software
engineer.
