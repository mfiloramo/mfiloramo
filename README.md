Hello! I'm a programming enthusiast looking to better my software development skills and
earn a junior software engineer position. Feel free to browse my ever-growing repositories,
to try my applications out, and to offer suggestions and improvements. I'm always learning,
and am excited to continue doing so for the entirety of my journey to become a great software
engineer.

Be sure to check out challenges.py and challenges_tests.py, a master list of all the challenges I've 
completed thus far. Also, checkout the various bots I've created: One that performs various functions
on Reddit, and one that plays a Space Invaders-type game that I've created.
